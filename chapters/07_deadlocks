CHAPTER 7 - DEADLOCKS
-------------------------------------------------

- System Model

    A system consists of a finite number of resources to be distributed among a
      number of competing processes.  Memory, CPU cycles, files, and IO devices are
      examples of resource types.

    A process may acquire and use resources.  The request and release of resources
      are system calls.
        1. Request
        2. Use
        3. Release

    Examples of request and release:
      request() and release()  a device
      open() and close()       a file
      allocate() and free()    memory
      wait() and signal()      for resources not managed by the OS



- Deadlock Characterization

    A deadlock situation can arise if the following 4 conditions hold 
      simultaneously in a system:

      1. Mutual Exclusion = at least one resource must be held in a nonsharable mode
      2. Hold and Wait    = a process must be holding at least one resource and
                              waiting to acquire additional resources held by other
                              processes
      3. No Preemption    = resources cannot be preempted, only released voluntarily
      4. Circular Wait    = p0 is waiting for p1, p1 for p2, p2 for p0



- Resource Allocation Graphs

    Deadlocks can be described in terms of a digraph called a System Resource
      Allocation Graph.  

      V = sets of all processes {P1, P2, ..., Pn} and resources {R1, R2, ..., Rn}

      A directed edge Pi->Ri is a 'request edge'
      A directed edge Ri->Pi is an 'assignment edge'


    If the graph contains no cycles, then no deadlock exists.  If the graph contains
      a cycle, deadlocks may exist.



- Methods for Handling Deadlocks

    Generally speaking, there are 3 ways to handle deadlocks:

      1. Use a protocol that prevents or avoids deadlocks, ensuring a deadlock never
           occurs in the system.

      2. Allow the system to enter a deadlock state, detect it, and recover.

      3. Ignore the problem and pretend that deadlocks do not occur.  (This is the
           method used by most operating systems, which is why it is up to 
           application developers to prevent it.)


    'Deadlock prevention' provides a set of methods for ensuring that at least one of
      the necessary conditions does not hold.

    'Deadlock avoidance' requires giving the OS additional information concerning which
      resources the process will use.
